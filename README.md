# HumanGL
This project is an introduction to hierarchical modeling and matrix stack manipulation.
We use matrices in order to link different parts of a model and make them move together in a logical way.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH:glfw/build/src
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0
```
